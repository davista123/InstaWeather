# InstaWeather
Get real time weather updates on your phone!




## Requirements

* Twilio API key
* OWM API key
* Any phone with a valid network provider


### _You can get these at :_

1. https://www.twilio.com
2. https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up

I also used the python library: PyOWM(https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm). Many thanks for simplyfying my code structure.


## Support

I have tested it on Python 3.5+ but I'm confident that any python version of 2.7+ can run it.

## Great, it works, what's the big deal?

* I am trying to explore the capabilities of building apps that do not require users to install the application itself. 
* Can we build apps that just work when most vonvenient for the user rather thn staying on the device?
